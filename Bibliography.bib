However, the circumstances under which females would benefit from honestly signalling their quality are limited. Females are not expected to invest in ornamentation unless the fitness benefits of the ornament exceed those derived from investing the resources directly into offspring. It has been proposed that when females gain direct benefits from mating, females may instead be selected for ornamentation that deceives males about their reproductive state. In the empidid dance flies, males frequently provide nuptial gifts and it is usually only the female that is ornamented. Female traits in empidids, such as abdominal sacs and enlarged pinnate leg scales, have been proposed to `deceive' males into matings by disguising egg maturity. We quantified sexual selection in the dance fly Rhamphomyia tarsata and found escalating, quadratic selection on pinnate scales and that pinnate scales honestly reflect female fecundity. Mated females had a larger total number and more mature eggs than unmated females, highlighting a potential benefit rather than a cost of male mate choice. We also show correlational selection on female pinnate scales and fecundity. Correlational selection, equivalent investment patterns or increased nutrition from nuptial gifts may all maintain honesty in female ornamentation.},

abstract = {Theories of parasite-mediated sexual selection predict a positive association between immune function and the expression of sexually selected ornaments. Few studies, however, have investigated how an immune challenge affects the performance of sexually selected weaponry. Male Wellington tree weta (Hemideina crassidens) (Orthoptera: Anostostomatidae) possess enlarged mandibles that are used as weapons in fights for access to females residing in tree galleries. Intense sexual competition appears to have favoured the evolution of alternative male mating strategies in this species as males have a trimorphic phenotype in which weapon size varies across morphotype: 8th instar males have the smallest jaws, 10th instar males have the largest and 9th instar males being intermediate to the other two. After injecting males and females with either lipopolysaccharide (LPS; immune challenge) or saline (control) I measured over a 24h period each weta's body mass to assess whether they responded immunologically to the LPS and their bite force to assess the functional performance of their jaws. Both sexes responded immunologically to the immune-challenge as LPS-injected individuals lost significantly more body mass than saline-injected controls with females losing more mass than males. Female bite force was significantly reduced 8h after LPS-injection whereas male bite force did not significantly decline. Both sexes regained pre-injection functional performance of their jaws 24h after the immune challenge. My results suggest that females trade-off bite force for immune function whereas males do not.

Whether measured during growth (ontogenetic allometry), among individuals at similar developmental stage (static allometry), or among populations or species (evolutionary allometry), allometric relationships are often tight and relatively invariant. Consequently, it has been suggested that allometries have low evolvability and could constrain phenotypic evolution by forcing evolving species along fixed trajectories. Alternatively, allometric relationships may result from natural selection for functional optimization. Despite nearly a century of active research, distinguishing between these alternatives remains difficult, partly due to wide differences in the meaning assigned to the term allometry. In particular, a broad use of the term, encompassing any monotonic relationship between body parts, has become common. This usage breaks the connection to the proportional growth regulation that motivated Huxley's original narrow-sense use of allometry to refer to power-law relationships between traits. Focusing on the narrow-sense definition of allometry, we review here evidence for and against the allometry-as-a-constraint hypothesis. Although the low evolvability and the evolutionary invariance of the static allometric slope observed in some studies suggest a possible constraining effect of this parameter on phenotypic evolution, the lack of knowledge about selection on allometry prevents firm conclusions.}, }

In this review, I show that this idea is contradicted by empirical evidence and theory. Although positive allometry is a typical attribute of some sexual traits in certain groups, the preponderance of positively allometric sexual traits in the empirical literature apparently results from a sampling bias reflecting a fascination with unusually exaggerated (bizarre) traits. I review empirical examples from a broad range of taxa illustrating the diversity of allometric patterns exhibited by signal, weapon, clasping and genital traits, as well as nonsexual traits. This evidence suggests that positive allometry may be the exception rather than the rule in sexual traits, that directional sexual selection does not necessarily lead to the evolution of positive allometry and, conversely, that positive allometry is not necessarily a consequence of sexual selection, and that many sexual traits exhibit sex differences in allometric intercept rather than slope. Such diversity in the allometries of secondary sexual traits is to be expected, given that optimal allometry should reflect resource allocation trade-offs, and patterns of sexual and viability selection on both trait size and body size. An unbiased empirical assessment of the relation between sexual selection and allometry is an essential step towards an understanding of this diversity.}, }

Male forceps are thought to be weapons in male contests for access to females, but recent findings suggest that females choose males on the basis of their forceps length. I investigated sexual selection on forceps length and body size and the occurrence of male-male competition. When I controlled for forceps length experimentally and statistically, relatively heavy males had greater copulation success than relatively light males. When I controlled for body size, males with relatively longer forceps had no tendency for greater copulation success than males with shorter forceps. Relatively heavy males more often took over copulations from smaller males than vice versa. Male contests were important for the outcome of mate competition, as males commonly interrupted and took over copulations. My results therefore suggest that intrasexual selection is significant in competition for copulations in male earwigs, and acts on body size. This contrasts with previous findings, which have shown intersexual selection on forceps length to be important. However, both modes of sexual selection may be acting through a two-stage process, where male-male competition first determines which males have access to females, and then through female choice among available males. Morphological measurements supported the conclusion that forceps length and body size are male secondary sexual characters, as these characters had large variance and skewed distributions in males, but were normally distributed in females.

The one-size-fits-all model of genital evolution attributes these patterns to stabilizing sexual selection. This model relies on the assumption that the observed patterns of variation and allometry reflect the form of sexual selection acting these traits. We test this by examining the patterns of scaling and trait variation for a set of genitalic and somatic morphological traits in male water striders (Aquarius remigis). This suite of traits is of particular interest because previous work has shown that the genitalic traits are under strong directional selection whereas the somatic traits are under either weak directional or stabilizing selection. Because the selection regime for these traits is known, we can, for the first time, test the purported relationship between trait variation, scaling, and the form of sexual selection. We show that the patterns of variation and scaling of these traits differ sharply from those predicted for traits experiencing strong directional sexual selection. Specifically, the male genital structures show static hypoallometry and low intrapopulational levels of phenotypic variation relative to other male traits, in spite of consistent, strong, directional sexual selection. These scaling relationships and levels of variation are typical of genital traits in other insect species, where they have been presumed to reflect stabilizing sexual selection. Our data clearly refute the assumption of the one-size-fits-all hypothesis that hypoallometric scaling of genitalic traits implies stabilizing selection. We discuss the implications of this finding and propose future directions for improving our current understanding of genital evolution in arthropods.}, }

abstract = {Regression analyses are central to characterization of the form and strength of natural selection in nature. Two common analyses that are currently used to characterize selection are (1) least squares-based approximation of the individual relative fitness surface for the purpose of obtaining quantitatively useful selection gradients, and (2) spline-based estimation of (absolute) fitness functions to obtain flexible inference of the shape of functions by which fitness and phenotype are related. These two sets of methodologies are often implemented in parallel to provide complementary inferences of the form of natural selection. We unify these two analyses, providing a method whereby selection gradients can be obtained for a given observed distribution of phenotype and characterization of a function relating phenotype to fitness. The method allows quantitatively useful selection gradients to be obtained from analyses of selection that adequately model nonnormal distributions of fitness, and provides unification of the two previously separate regression-based fitness analyses. We demonstrate the method by calculating directional and quadratic selection gradients associated with a smooth regression-based generalized additive model of the relationship between neonatal survival and the phenotypic traits of gestation length and birth mass in humans.}, }

Despite being model systems for the study of male aggression in Western science and for cricket fights in Chinese culture, field crickets (Orthoptera, Gryllidae, Gryllinae) are not known to possess sexually dimorphic weaponry. In a wild population of the fall field cricket, Gryllus pennsylvanicus, we report sexual dimorphism in head size as well as the size of mouthparts, both of which are used when aggressive contests between males escalate to physical combat. Male G. pennsylvanicus have larger heads, maxillae and mandibles than females when controlling for pronotum length. We conducted two experiments to test the hypothesis that relatively larger weaponry conveys an advantage to males in aggressive contests. Pairs of males were selected for differences in head size and consequently were different in the size of maxillae and mandibles. In the first experiment, males were closely matched for body size (pronotum length), and in the second, they were matched for body mass. Males with proportionately larger weaponry won more fights and increasing differences in weaponry size between males increased the fighting success of the male with the larger weaponry. This was particularly true when contests escalated to grappling, the most intense level of aggression. However, neither contest duration nor intensity was related to weaponry size as predicted by models of contest settlement. These results are the first evidence that the size of the head capsule and mouthparts are under positive selection via male-male competition in field crickets, and validate 800-year-old Chinese traditional knowledge.}, }

abstract = {Morphological traits often covary within and among species according to simple power laws referred to as allometry. Such allometric relationships may result from common growth regulation, and this has given rise to the hypothesis that allometric exponents may have low evolvability and constrain trait evolution. We formalize hypotheses for how allometry may constrain morphological trait evolution across taxa, and test these using more than 300 empirical estimates of static (within-species) allometric relations of animal morphological traits. Although we find evidence for evolutionary changes in allometric parameters on million-year, cross-species time scales, there is limited evidence for microevolutionary changes in allometric slopes. Accordingly, we find that static allometries often predict evolutionary allometries on the subspecies level, but less so across species. Although there is a large body of work on allometry in a broad sense that includes all kinds of morphological trait-size relationships, we found relatively little information about the evolution of allometry in the narrow sense of a power relationship. Despite the many claims of microevolutionary changes of static allometries in the literature, hardly any of these apply to narrow-sense allometry, and we argue that the hypothesis of strongly constrained static allometric slopes remains viable.

The production of exaggerated traits can come at a cost to other traits through trade-offs when resources allocated to trait development are limited. Alternatively some traits can be selected for in parallel to support or compensate for the cost of bearing the exaggerated trait. Male giraffe weevils (Lasiorhynchus barbicornis) display an extremely elongated rostrum used as a weapon during contests for mates. Here we characterise the scaling relationship between rostrum and body size and show that males have a steep positive allometry, but that the slope is non-linear due to a relative reduction in rostrum length for the largest males, suggesting a limitation in resource allocation or a diminishing requirement for large males to invest increasingly into larger rostra. We also measured testes, wings, antennae, fore- and hind-tibia size and found no evidence of a trade-off between these traits and rostrum length when comparing phenotypic correlations. However, the relative length of wings, antennae, fore- and hind-tibia all increased with relative rostrum length suggesting these traits may be under correlational selection. Increased investment in wing and leg length is therefore likely to compensate for the costs of flying with, and wielding the exaggerated rostrum of larger male giraffe weevils. These results provide a first step in identifying the potential for trait compensation and trades-offs, but are phenotypic correlations only and should be interpreted with care in the absence of breeding experiments.}, }

This characteristic has promoted the study of postcopulatory sexual selection in several representative species. Here, previous studies of earwigs that examined pre‐ and postcopulatory sexual selection are reviewed in detail.

Understanding the relationship between these two types of allometry is crucial to understanding the evolution of allometry and, more generally, the evolution of shape. However, the effects of ontogenetic allometry on static allometry remain largely unexplored. Here, we first show analytically how individual variation in ontogenetic allometry and body size affect static allometry. Using two longitudinal data sets on ontogenetic and static allometry, we then estimate variances and covariances for the different parameters of the ontogenetic allometry defined in our model and assess their relative contribution to the static allometric slope. The mean ontogenetic allometry is the main parameter that determines the static allometric slope, while the covariance between the ontogenetic allometric slope and body size generates most of the discrepancies between ontogenetic and static allometry. These results suggest that the apparent evolutionary stasis of the static allometric slope is not generated by internal (developmental) constraints but more likely results from external constraints imposed by selection.}, }

abstract = {Abstract Competition for mates can drive the evolution of exaggerated weaponry and male dimorphism associated with alternative reproductive tactics. In terrestrial arthropods, male dimorphism is often detected as non-linear allometries, where the scaling relationship between weapon size and body size differs in intercept and/or slope between morphs. Understanding the patterns of non-linear allometries is important as it can provide insights into threshold evolution and the strength of selection experienced by each morph. Numerous studies in male-dimorphic arthropods have reported that allometric slopes of weapons are shallower in large ``major'' males compared to small ``minor'' males. Because this pattern is common among beetles that undergo complete metamorphosis (holometabolous), researchers have hypothesized that the slope change reflects resource depletion during pupal development. However, no comprehensive survey has examined the generality of this trend. We systematically searched the literature for reports of weapon allometries in male dimorphic species and conducted a phylogenetically controlled meta-analysis to explore the factors influencing the difference in slopes between morphs. Our search identified 59 effect sizes from 19 studies, 50 species, and 5 orders of terrestrial arthropods. We found strong evidence that metamorphosis type influences the patterns of weapon allometries. Slopes were significantly steeper in minor males compared to major males in holometabolous species, but there was no difference in slopes between morphs in hemimetabolous species (i.e. those that undergo incomplete or no metamorphosis). These results support the hypothesis that holometabolous species face a resource ceiling during pupal development that limits the exaggeration of weapon size.}, }

To begin to unravel the mechanisms producing this striking dimorphism, we examined which morphological traits best explain body size variation in bruchid beetles and quantified sexual dimorphism of antenna size through allometric analyses. Using principal component analyses, we found that elytron length and pronotum width were significantly correlated with the first principal component, which was interpreted as explaining variation in body size. Regressions of log‐transformed body size measures on log‐transformed antenna length revealed that males of both species had longer antennae than conspecific females for any given body size, although most of this effect was attributable to higher intercepts, rather than increased allometry, in males. Comparisons among heterospecific males revealed that C. maculatus males have noticeably longer antennae than C. chinensis males at large body sizes. Callosobruchus chinensis males, thus, appear to have increased the receptive area of their antennae by adding to the width of, rather than further elongating, their antennae. Finally, we found evidence for positive allometry between log‐transformed antenna length and log‐transformed antenna width in C. chinensis males. We discuss our results in the context of evidence supporting the presence of an additional, and potentially unique, sex pheromone in C. chinensis females.}, }

abstract = {Sexually selected traits, including threat signals, have been shown to scale steeply positively with body size because their exaggeration maximizes honest signalling. However, the functional allometry hypothesis makes the opposite prediction for some weapons: because the biomechanics of force applied in their use may favor relatively smaller size, sexually selected weapons may exhibit negative allometry. Tests of these ideas in insects have largely focused on holometabolous species, whose adult body size is entirely dependent on nutrients acquired during the larval stage. In contrast, hemimetabolous insects may exhibit different patterns of allometry development because they forage throughout development, between successive moults. Here, we tested complementary and competing predictions made by the positive and functional allometry hypotheses, regarding intrasexually selected trait allometry in a hemimetabolous insect, the Jamaican field cricket (Gryllus assimilis). As expected, head width (a dominance and/or combat trait) was more positively allometric than non-sexually selected traits. In contrast, and consistent with the functional allometry hypothesis, mouthparts (weapons) were either isometric or negatively allometric. We also tested whether trait allometry responded to rearing diet by raising males on either a high protein diet or a high carbohydrate diet; we predicted stronger positive allometry under the high protein diet. However, diet did not influence allometry in the predicted manner. Overall, our results support the functional allometry hypothesis regarding sexually selected trait allometry and raise intriguing possibilities for integrating these ideas with recent paradigms for classifying intrasexually selected traits.}, }

Condition dependency is empirically inferred by the sensitivity of traits to stressors. The magnitude of ecological stress (e.g., competition and predation) experienced by populations varies considerably. Thus, condition dependence should manifest more in populations experiencing higher levels of stress. We experimentally assessed the sensitivity of a sexually selected trait (posterior gnathopod) to food resource stress in an amphipod species. We found that gnathopod size variation was 59\% higher under food stress, with no corresponding effect on nonsexually selected traits. In addition, we assessed levels of gnathopod variation and the allometry of gnathopods for males sampled from natural populations for two amphipod species that experience different levels of stress (driven by contrasting size-selective predation and associated life-history trade-offs). Populations that experience higher resource stress had both steeper allometries and greater gnathopod size variation. These results suggest that the magnitude of ecological stress experienced by natural populations strongly impacts condition dependency of sexually selected traits, and could play an important role in shaping trait variation and thus the opportunity for sexual selection.}, }

abstract = {Sexual selection is thought to be an important driver of adaptation, speciation and extinction. Empirically testing these predictions across macroevolutionary timescales first requires an understanding of the morphology of secondary sexual traits in extant taxa. We used three-dimensional geometric morphometrics to analyse a large sample of the skull of the blue wildebeest, Connochaetes taurinus, in which horns are found in both sexes but only used in intrasexual competition in males. We show that the horns fit several predictions of secondary sexual traits; overall skull shape is significantly correlated with size (R\textsuperscript{2} = 0.38, p = 0.001), and the sexually selected horns show drastically higher growth rates and variation than any other skull element, supporting previous findings. We also find that despite showing significant sexual dimorphism in shape and size (R\textsuperscript{2} = 0.21, p = 0.001), allometric growth trajectories of sexes are identical (R\textsuperscript{2} = 0.01, p = 0.635) and dimorphism is not readily detectable without prior knowledge of sex, and is not possible when shape is corrected for size. Our results show that even with strong sexual selection operating in only one sex, the expression of secondary sexual traits may show characteristic and indistinguishable patterns of growth and variance in both sexes.}, }

abstract = {Allometry of secondary sexual traits has been the subject of recent debate, and the generality of positive allometry and its association with sexual selection have been recently questioned. Whereas some studies suggest an almost universal positive allometry for traits under sexual selection and isometry or a negative allometry for traits not under such pressure, other studies argue that this pattern results from the study of exaggerated (ornamental) traits. To answer the call for an examination of the allometry of less-exaggerated sexually selected traits, we have examined morphological data from 14 sexually dimorphic traits and six monomorphic traits from three anuran species. Although we found evidence of positive allometry in male secondary sexual traits of several species and populations, not all nonsexual traits were isometric or exhibited negative allometry. Furthermore, our results indicate that larger traits in the populations that we studied were not associated with greater allometric slopes. Therefore, our study is in line with the contention suggesting no specific kind of allometric pattern for sexual and nonsexual characters, and we can only advocate for further investigation of trait allometry and sexual selection to understand the complexity underlying the evolution of allometry in sexual traits.}, }

abstract = {Regressions of biological variables across species are rarely perfect. Usually, there are residual deviations from the estimated model relationship, and such deviations commonly show a pattern of phylogenetic correlations indicating that they have biological causes. We discuss the origins and effects of phylogenetically correlated biological variation in regression studies. In particular, we discuss the interplay of biological deviations with deviations due to observational or measurement errors, which are also important in comparative studies based on estimated species means. We show how bias in estimated evolutionary regressions can arise from several sources, including phylogenetic inertia and either observational or biological error in the predictor variables. We show how all these biases can be estimated and corrected for in the presence of phylogenetic correlations. We present general formulas for incorporating measurement error in linear models with correlated data. We also show how alternative regression models, such as major axis and reduced major axis regression, which are often recommended when there is error in predictor variables, are strongly biased when there is biological variation in any part of the model. We argue that such methods should never be used to estimate evolutionary or allometric regression slopes.}, }

Most traits scale proportionally with each other and body size such that larger adults are essentially magnified versions of smaller ones. This pattern is so ubiquitous that departures from it - disproportionate scaling between trait and body size - pique interest because it can generate dramatically exaggerated traits. These extreme morphologies are frequently hypothesized to result from sexual selection and their study has a long history, with several hypotheses seeking to explain their evolution. Despite this effort, surprisingly little progress has been made in demonstrating the forms of selection that produce different scaling patterns or in identifying the mechanisms that underlie the expression and evolution of scaling relationships. Here we review recent insights regarding the proximate mechanisms that regulate and integrate trait growth and that offer a new framework for studying the evolution of morphological scaling.}, }

abstract = {Log-linear models are widely used for assessing determinants of fitness in empirical studies, for example, in determining how reproductive output depends on trait values or environmental conditions. Similarly, theoretical works of fitness and natural selection employ log-linear models, often with a negative quadratic term, generating Gaussian fitness functions. However, in the specific application of regression-based analysis of natural selection, such models are rarely employed. Rather, OLS regression is the predominant means of assessing the form of natural selection. OLS regressions allow specific evolutionary quantitative parameters, selection gradients, to be estimated, and benefit from the fact that the associated statistical models are easily applied. We examine whether selection gradients can be directly expressed in terms of the coefficients of models using exponential fitness functions with linear or quadratic arguments. Such models can be easily fitted with generalized linear models (GLMs). The expressions we obtain coincide with those for Gaussian functions, but relax the major constraint that the (log) fitness function is concave (downwardly curved). Additionally these results lead to univariate and multivariate analyses of both linear and quadratic selection that potentially incorporate pragmatic and interpretable models of fitness functions, where the parameters can be related analytically to selection gradients, and that can be operationalized using widely available statistical tools.},

abstract = {Summary Aspects of locomotor performance are thought to be important in a variety of natural contexts, including foraging and escaping from predators. The role of locomotor abilities in sexual selection is less well documented, but is probably of wide importance. Sexual selection may exaggerate traits beyond their optimum with respect to biomechanical or physiological function, thus imposing `costs' of various types. Locomotor performance, in conjunction with its lower‐level determinants and its behavioural and ecological consequences, constitutes an ideal set of phenotypes with which to study such costs. Organisms may possess traits that compensate for the negative effects of sexually selected traits on performance abilities. Ignoring these may lead to erroneous conclusions about the cost of a putatively sexually selected trait. At the same time, ignoring the effects of sexual selection on functionally important traits may lead us to underestimate their functional significance. Many properties of organisms are affected by, or at least correlate with, overall body size, so this must be considered in any study of adaptation or sexual selection. For interspecific or interpopulation comparative studies, phylogeny must also be considered in statistical analyses. We present a hypothetical data set that illustrates the perils of ignoring potential compensatory mechanisms when studying the costs of a sexually selected trait. We also discuss different ways of studying costs, including analyses of a single sex and of the differences between the sexes.}, }

abstract = {Multicollinearity represents a high degree of linear intercorrelation between explanatory variables in a multiple regression model and leads to incorrect results of regression analyses. Diagnostic tools of multicollinearity include the variance inflation factor (VIF), condition index and condition number, and variance decomposition proportion (VDP). The multicollinearity can be expressed by the coefficient of determination (Rh2) of a multiple regression model with one explanatory variable (Xh) as the model's response variable and the others (Xi [i ≠ h]) as its explanatory variables. The variance (σh2) of the regression coefficients constituting the final regression model are proportional to the VIF. Hence, an increase in Rh2 (strong multicollinearity) increases σh2. The larger σh2 produces unreliable probability values and confidence intervals of the regression coefficients. The square root of the ratio of the maximum eigenvalue to each eigenvalue from the correlation matrix of standardized explanatory variables is referred to as the condition index. The condition number is the maximum condition index. Multicollinearity is present when the VIF is higher than 5 to 10 or the condition indices are higher than 10 to 30. However, they cannot indicate multicollinear explanatory variables. VDPs obtained from the eigenvectors can identify the multicollinear variables by showing the extent of the inflation of σh2 according to each condition index. When two or more VDPs, which correspond to a common condition index higher than 10 to 30, are higher than 0.8 to 0.9, their associated explanatory variables are multicollinear. Excluding multicollinear explanatory variables leads to statistically stable multiple regression models.}, }

abstract = {The fitness function f relates fitness of individuals to the quantitative trait under natural selection. The function is useful in predicting fitness differences among individuals and in revealing whether an optimum is present within the range of phenotypes in the population. It may also be thought of as describing the ecological environment in terms of the trait. Quadratic regression will approximate the fitness function from data (e.g., Lande and Arnold, 1983), but the method does not reliably indicate features of f such as the presence of modes (stabilizing selection) or dips (disruptive selection). I employ an alternative procedure requiring no a priori model for the function. The method is useful in two ways: it provides a nonparametric estimate of f, of interest by itself, and it can be used to suggest an appropriate parametric model. I also discuss measures of selection intensity based on the fitness function. Analysis of six data sets yields a variety of forms of f and provides new insights for some familiar cases. Low amounts of variation and a low density of data points near the tails of many phenotype distributions emerge as limitations to gaining information on fitness functions. An experimental approach in which the distribution of a quantitative trait is broadened through manipulation would minimize these problems.}, }
